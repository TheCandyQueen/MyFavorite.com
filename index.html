        <p>I like art because it makes me forget to worry about things, like school. I also love art because when I finish something like sculpting or a painting and it turns out the way I want it, then it feels very satisfying. It is extremely satisfying to take a blank page and then turn it into something beatuiful. Also it is very creative and specific to that one person. Art allows you to express your feelings easier than writing.
